# skill

skill pallet aggregates certain datapoints for users of the entire zero multiverse

## data

### XP

XP represents experience of a user. it is an abstract number reflecting monetary interactions and increases based on complexity of transactions completed. for example simple buy / sell tx lead to a +1, while supporting a project with a prepaid campaign purchase gives a 10 and a loan gives a 100. datapoints leading to an increase need to be collected here.

### REP

REP represents reputation of a user. it is a social measurement reflecting interactions with users, projects and the community. bad behaviour can lead to reduction of REP. continuously negative input can lead to warnings or banning of the user.
